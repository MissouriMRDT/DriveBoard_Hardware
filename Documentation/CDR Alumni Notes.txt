JACOB LIPINA LAYOUT NOTES:
I'm sorry if some of these points were hit on at your actual CDR and that since I didn't attend, I may not fully understand this year's layout constraints.
So as always, take or leave any of these comments. Up to yall to decide what's important to act on.

- This board looks taller than necessary. I would have expected the TIVA to be rotated 90deg so that the ethernet and pwr conn
aren't pointing straight up, causing interference with the lid. But, I dont know how/where this brd is mounted in the frame, so 
you guys will know if the top side is appropriate for the pwr and ethernet conn. In the past, we have had the data Molexs on the top though.

- The data Molex conn look too close together. They might solder on fine, but remember to have space for fingers to come in and de-mate connectors.

- On the molex conn silk, I would put the ref designator (Conn1 - Conn6) on the bottom layer so that the more descriptive silk (FL, etc) 
is easier to read at a glance.

- Overall, on the silk for function descriptions, (example FWD and RSV on the slide switch) make them larger so they're easier to read at a distance.
It'll make them stand out from the part ref designators. I wound also consider using silk to put boxes around groups of LEDS with similar purposes
to make interpretation more intuitive. 

- 'SW4', 'Conn 13' silk is not active. Up to you to care. Meh

- Why skip from Conn6 to Conn13?

- I might consider nudging the diagonal 5V trace inwards where it gets very close to the board outline in the corner of the ethernet cutout.

- Your passives are very close to each other and the other parts. If a bit more space is given around parts, it would make handsoldering or rework easier. 
This is not a requirement since the pads are not literally overlapping, but more a quality of life thing when soldering or debugging with probes.

- So the direction switch LED indicates the FWD position. Ok. The schematic symbol doesn't match the type of switch used in reality.

- Any reason some signal traces are 10mil and some are 15mil? Looks like space in between pins was limited. 10mil is an acceptable width, so you're fine.
I just like consistency dammit.

- GND planes and their stitching look to leave good paths back to 12V source GND. Nice

- Rounded brd corners, thank god.
